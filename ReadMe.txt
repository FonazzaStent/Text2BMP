The app reads content from a text file and converts it to a BMP image. The image is in 640x480 8 bit BMP format.

Press the "Convert" button to load your text file. Choose a filename and folder to save the BMP file when prompted. The program will display the resulting image. You will find the BMP file in the folder where you have saved it for any further manipulation, for storing or sharing it.
You can have fun trying to spot recognizable shapes (pareidolias) in the resulting image.
