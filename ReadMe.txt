Text to BMP 1.2.1

The app reads content from a text file and converts it to a BMP image.

Press the "Convert" button to load your text file. Choose a filename and
folder to save the BMP file when prompted. The program will display the
resulting image. You will find the BMP file in the folder where you have
saved it for any further manipulation, for storing or sharing it.
You can have fun trying to spot recognizable shapes (pareidolias) in the
resulting image.
